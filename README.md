## Hi there! My name is Evelyn
### I am a Cloud Engineer

I am a junior Cloud Engineer proficient in AWS services such as CloudWatch, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, EC2, IAM Users & Roles, Lambda and serverless architecture, with experience in using Docker and Linux.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also well-versed in Agile methodologies and use tools such as Jira to manage and track tasks and projects. I understand the importance of clear and concise documentation. This helps ensure that all team members have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be done.

I also use Drow.io to draw AWS architecture diagrams, this helps me to visualize and communicate the infrastructure design and dependencies to the team members and stakeholders. This improves the efficiency of the team and ensures that projects are delivered on time, on budget, and to the highest quality. Overall, I believe that good documentation and use of agile methodologies, along with visualization tools such as Draw.io, are key to delivering successful projects and I make sure to apply them in my daily work.

Currently working on a 12-week Cloud Engineering project on AWS by Nexascale and AtheriaHQ
